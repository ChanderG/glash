Go Light-on-features tries-to-be-Anonymous SHell

### Features

1. Opinionated. Absolutely no external configuration. Customized to my needs.
2. Very light on features.
3. No history stored anywhere.
4. To be used on the go, not installed.

### Motivation

Use different campus computers, to `ssh` back to my own machine in the network. Need to keep my contact on those machines as discrete as possible. This is a step in that direction.
